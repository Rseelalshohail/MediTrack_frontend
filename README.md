# MediTrack_frontend

## Project Overview:
Create a full-stack web application for hospital staff to manage medical devices, work
orders (CM and PPM), spare parts requests, and annual inventory checks. The system
must have user roles (Nurse, Engineer, Admin) with different permissions based on the
role.
